    "\n",
    "This model simulates the supply-demand balance of the Western Climate Initiative cap-and-trade program, jointly operated by California and Quebec.\n",
    "\n",
    "This interactive online version of the model allows you simulate a range of supply-demand scenarios through 2030, as determined by three core assumptions about the future:\n",
    "1. Covered greenhouse gas emissions\n",
    "2. Quarterly allowance auction outcomes\n",
    "3. Carbon offset supplies\n",
    "\n",
    "Each assumption can be set in \"simple\" mode to quickly specify a scenario, or can be set in \"advanced\" or \"custom\" mode for more detailed specifications. Click on the tabs in each category to choose the level of control over the settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have created your desired scenario, click the button \"Run supply-demand calculations\" to see the results. When you click the run button, the settings in the tabs that are open will be used for the model run."
