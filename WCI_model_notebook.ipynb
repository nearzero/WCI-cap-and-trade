When the supply of compliance instruments entering private accounts is greater than covered emissions in a given year, the private bank increases. When the supply of compliance instruments entering private accounts is less than covered emissions, the private bank decreases.</p><br><p>The figure on the right shows the running total of compliance instruments banked in private accounts. In addition, the graph shows any allowances that went unsold in auctions. These allowances are held in government accounts until they are either reintroduced at a later auction or removed from the normal auction supply subject to market rules.</p><br><p>If the private bank is exhausted, the model simulates reserve sales to meet any remaining outstanding compliance obligations, based on the user-defined emissions projection. Starting in 2021, if the supply of allowances held in government-controlled reserve accounts is exhausted, then an unlimited quantity of instruments called “price ceiling units” will be available at a price ceiling to meet any remaining compliance obligations. The model tracks the sale of reserve allowances and price ceiling units in a single composite category.</p><br><p>For more information about the banking metric used here, see Near Zero's Sep. 2018 report, <a href='http://www.nearzero.org/wp/2018/09/12/tracking-banking-in-the-western-climate-initiative-cap-and-trade-program/' target='_blank'>Tracking Banking in the Western Climate Initiative Cap-and-Trade Program</a href>.</p>\"\n",

Users can specify higher or lower emissions scenarios using the available settings.</p><br><p>A 2% rate of decline follows ARB's 2017 Scoping Plan scenario for California emissions, which includes the effects of prescriptive policy measures (e.g., the Renewables Portfolio Standard for electricity), but does not incorporate effects of the cap-and-trade program.</p><br><p>Note that PATHWAYS, the model ARB used to generate the Scoping Plan scenario, does not directly project covered emissions in California. Instead, the PATHWAYS model tracks emissions from four economic sectors called “covered sectors,” which together constitute about ~10% more emissions than the “covered emissions” that are actually subject to the cap-and-trade program in California. For more information, see Near Zero's May 2018 <a href='http://www.nearzero.org/wp/2018/05/07/ready-fire-aim-arbs-overallocation-report-misses-its-target/' target='_blank'>report on this discrepancy</a href>.

However, users can specify a custom percentage of allowances to go unsold at auction in one or more years. This percentage applies to both current and advance auctions, in each quarter of the user-specified years.</p><br><p>To date, most current auctions have sold out. But in 2016 and 2017, 143 million current allowances went unsold as sales collapsed over several auctions. Pursuant to market rules, most of these allowances are now being reintroduced for sale in current auctions.</p><br><p>If California state-owned allowances remain unsold for more than 24 months, they are removed from the normal auction supply and transferred to the market reserve accounts. Quebec's current regulations do not contain a similar stipulation. We calculate that this self-correction mechanism will remove 38 – 52 million previously unsold allowances from the normal auction supply, with the exact amount dependent on the outcomes of the next two quarterly auctions. The remaining 91 – 105 million allowance will have been reintroduced at auction.</p><br><p>For more information, see Near Zero's May 2018 <a href='http://www.nearzero.org/wp/2018/05/23/californias-self-correcting-cap-and-trade-auction-mechanism-does-not-eliminate-market-overallocation/' target='_blank'>report on this <q>self correction</q> mechanism</a href>.</p>\"\n",

These credits represent emission reductions that take place outside of the cap-and-trade program and are credited pursuant to an approved offset protocol.</p><br><p>For California, the limits on offset usage are equal to a percentage of a covered entity’s compliance obligations: through 2020, the limit is 8%; from 2021 through 2025, the limit is 4%; and from 2026 through 2030, the limit is 6%. For Quebec, the limit is 8% for all years.</p><br><p>The model incorporates actual offset supply through Q3 2018, based on ARB’s Q3 2018 compliance instrument report for the WCI system. By default, the model assumes offset supply in any year is equivalent to three-quarters of the limit in each jurisdiction, reflecting ARB’s assumptions in the current proposed cap-and-trade regulations. Users can specify a higher or lower offset supply using the available settings.</p><br><p>Like allowances, offsets can also be banked for future use. Thus, we include offsets in our banking calculations.
